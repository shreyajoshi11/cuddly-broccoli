    "The two classifiers we have chosen are K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification and Logistic Regression. KNN is non-parametric so it does not make assumptions about the data distribution. It also classifies data points based on their closest neighbors, so it can capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data. We also chose Logistic Regression because it works well with binary variables and as our response variable is binary, it would be useful.\n",

The accuracy score measures overall correctness, and a higher score is better as this means it correctly classified a larger proportion of instances. AUC score evaluates a classifierâ€™s ability to distinguish between classes by measuring the area under the ROC curve, which plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate (sensitivity and specificity). A higher AUC score indicates better classification performance.\n",
