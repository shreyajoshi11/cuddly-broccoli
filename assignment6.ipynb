    "## Assignment Standards\n",
    "\n",
    "Please ensure your assignment adheres to the following standards for submission:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Title Page Requirements: Each submission must include a title page featuring your group members' names and student IDs. Assignments without a title page will not be considered for grading.\n",
    "- Formatting Preferences: The use of Quarto Jupyter Notebook for document preparation is highly recommended.\n",

    "- Individual Work: While discussing homework problems with peers and other groups is permitted, the final written submission must be your group work.\n",
    "- Submission Content: Do not include the assignment questions within your PDF. Instead, clearly mark each response with the corresponding question number. Screenshots are not an acceptable form of submission under any circumstances.\n",
    "- Academic Writing: Ensure that your writing and any references used are appropriate for an undergraduate level of study.\n",
    "- Originality Checks: Be aware that the instructor may use various tools, including online resources or in-person meetings, to verify the originality of submitted work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Policy on the Use of Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "- The use of Generative AI is not permitted in assignments, except for using GitHub Copilot as a coding assistant.\n",
    "    - If GitHub Copilot is used, you must clearly indicate this in the code comments.\n",
    "-   In alignment with [McMaster academic integrity policy](https://secretariat.mcmaster.ca/app/uploads/Academic-Integrity-Policy-1-1.pdf), it \"shall be an offence knowingly to submit academic work for assessment that was purchased or acquired from another source\". This includes work created by generative AI tools. Also state in the policy is the following, \"Contract Cheating is the act of \"outsourcing of student work to third parties\" with or without payment.\" Using Generative AI tools is a form of contract cheating. Charges of academic dishonesty will be brought forward to the Office of Academic Integrity.\n",

    "## Heart Disease Classification Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will analyze the UCI Heart Disease Dataset, which contains medical records used to predict the presence of heart disease in patients. The dataset includes a mix of categorical and numerical variables, some missing values, and class imbalance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the context of data science methods for heart disease prediction, refer to \n",
    "- Detrano, R., et., al. (1989). International application of a new probability algorithm for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The American journal of cardiology, 64(5), 304-310. DOI:[10.1016/0002-9149(89)90524-9](https://doi.org/10.1016/0002-9149(89)90524-9).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Information \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository:  \n",
    "ðŸ”— [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Key Features:  \n",
    "    - The dataset includes 303 observations with 13 features.  \n",
    "    - Features include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, electrocardiographic results, and others.  \n",
    "    - The response variable is `num`, which will be transformed to binary in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze the dataset using **two classification algorithms**. Your analysis should include exploratory data analysis, handling of missing values, feature selection, feature engineering, modeling, interpretation, and effective communication. The goal is to draw meaningful and well-supported conclusions from your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classifier requirement: **At least one** of the classifiers must be interpretable to allow for in-depth analysis and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Address the following questions in your submission, providing detailed insights and conclusions based on your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define and describe a classification problem using the dataset.\n",
    "2. Apply any chosen data transformations, or explain why no transformations were necessary.\n",
    "3. Provide a detailed description of the dataset, including variables, summaries, number of observations, data types, and distributions (include at least three statements).\n",
    "4. Transform the response `num` into a binary outcome: `1` for heart disease and `0` for no heart disease. So combine 1, 2, 3, and 4 into `1` and 0 for `0`. For Questions 4-16, use the transformed binary outcome.\n",
    "5. Analyze relationships between variables and discuss their implications for feature selection or extraction (include at least two statements).\n",
    "6. Drop the rows with the missing values. How many osbervations after dropping the missing values. Skip the outlier analysis.\n",
    "7. Sub-group analysis: Explore potential sub-groups within the data using appropriate data science methods. Identify and visualize these sub-groups without using the labels and categorical variables. Categroical variables already define sub groups so we don't need to include them for this analysis. \n",
    "8. Split 30% of the data for testing using a random seed of 1. Use the remaining 70% for training and model selection.\n",
    "9. Identify the two classifiers you have chosen. Justify your selections based on the classifier requirement for this assignment.\n",
    "10. Specify two metrics to compare classifier performance. Provide technical details on how each metric is computed.\n",
    "11. Train two selected classifiers in (9) and identify optimal tuning parameters (if applicable) using the training set.\n",
    "12. Apply a feature selection or extraction method to one of the classifiers in (9). Train this third classifier on the training set and identify optimal tuning parameters (if applicable) using the training set.\n",
    "13. Use the selected metrics to evaluate three classifiers in (11) and (12) on the test set.\n",
    "    - Discuss your findings (at least two statements).\n",
    "    - Discuss the impact of feature selection or extraction on the performance of the classifier (at least one statement).\n",
    "14. For the best interpretable model identified in (13), analyze and interpret the most important predictor variables in the context of the classification challenge (at least two statements).\n",
    "15. **[Bonus]** Sub-group improvement strategy: If sub-groups were identified, propose and implement a method to further improve the performance of **one** classifier. Compare the fourth classifier performance with the results from (13).\n",
    "16. **Team Contributions:** Document each team memberâ€™s specific contributions to the questions above. For group submissions, this should match the GitHub commit history. Individual submissions do not need to address this question.\n",
    "17. **Link** to the public GitHub repository. This is optional for the individual submissions.\n",
